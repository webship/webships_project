# Webships Project

A ready-to-use Drupal API project.

The site serves a JSON:API from `/api`, with authentication, authorization and
OpenAPI documentation rendered by Swagger UI at `/api-docs`. Everything comes
from drupal.org.

The project requires only the [Webships](https://www.drupal.org/project/webships)
installer and two site templates. The installer lists them:

- [Webships Starter](https://www.drupal.org/project/webships_starter): the
  default site template for Webships, with the apps and organizations content
  model and its API resources.
- [WebAPI Starter](https://www.drupal.org/project/webapi_starter): the basic
  default Drupal API site template, with the standard content model.

Both use the Drupal core administration theme, for the back end and the front
end.

## Create a project

Composer runs inside DDEV, so nothing is needed on your machine but DDEV itself.

```shell
mkdir my-api && cd my-api
ddev config --project-type=drupal --docroot=web
ddev start
ddev composer create-project drupal/webships_project:~12.0
ddev restart
```

`ddev restart` picks up the `.ddev/config.yaml` the template ships (PHP 8.4,
Node.js 20, MariaDB 10.11), which lands in the project during
`ddev composer create-project` and replaces the one `ddev config` wrote. The
project name is not in that file: DDEV takes it from the directory, so the site
is at `https://<directory>.ddev.site`.

## Install the site

Open the site and follow the installer, where you pick the site template:

```shell
ddev launch
```

Or install from the command line, with the Webships Starter site template:

```shell
ddev drush site:install ../recipes/webships_starter -y --account-name=webmaster --site-name="My API"
```

The path is relative to the Drupal root. Use `webships_starter` or `webapi_starter`.

## Project layout

| Path | Content |
|---|---|
| `web/` | Drupal root (core, contrib modules and themes) |
| `web/profiles/contrib/webships` | The Webships installer |
| `web/libraries/swagger-ui/dist` | Swagger UI, for the API documentation |
| `recipes/webships_starter` | The Webships Starter site template |
| `recipes/webapi_starter` | The WebAPI Starter site template |
| `vendor/` | Composer dependencies, Drush |

## What is inside

- Drupal core 11.4. Drupal 12 (beta, PHP 8.5) is allowed too; see below.
- [Web API](https://www.drupal.org/project/webapi): JSON:API from `/api`,
  read-only, with OAuth 2.0 and consumers.
- OpenAPI documents for JSON:API and REST, rendered with Swagger UI.

## Drupal 12 (beta)

The template installs the latest Drupal 11 by default. It also allows Drupal 12,
which needs PHP 8.5. To try it, set `php_version: "8.5"` in `.ddev/config.yaml`
(a DDEV release with PHP 8.5 is needed), then:

```shell
ddev restart
ddev composer require --no-update drupal/core-recommended:^12 drupal/search:^1
ddev composer update -W
```

Search left Drupal core in Drupal 12; Webships Starter uses it, so the contrib
`drupal/search` module comes with the upgrade.

Contributed modules that don't declare Drupal 12 support yet are allowed by the
`mglaman/composer-drupal-lenient` plugin (`extra.drupal-lenient.allowed-list`).
Some of them still fail on Drupal 12.

## Write operations

JSON:API is read-only. Turn write operations on at
`/admin/config/services/jsonapi` only when the site needs them, and rebuild the
cache afterwards.

## Cross-origin requests

CORS lives in `sites/default/services.yml` under `cors.config`. No module can
ship it, so set it per site.
